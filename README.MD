# Laravel Foundation Package – Iquesters <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7593318?s=200&v=4" alt="Iquesters Logo" width="40" style="vertical-align: middle;"/>

A powerful and reusable **foundation management package** for Laravel,  
developed and maintained by **[Iquesters](https://github.com/iquesters)**.

This package provides the **base structure, migrations, and seeders** required for  
handling **modules** and other foundational data within a Laravel application.  
It serves as the **core dependency** for many other Iquesters packages.

---

## ⚙️ Purpose

The **Foundation Package** acts as the **base layer** for modular Laravel development.  
It defines the common database schema, model structure, and seed data logic  
that other packages rely on — ensuring consistency and interoperability  
across all Iquesters Laravel modules.

## 🚀 Installation

1. Require the package using Composer:

   ```bash
   composer require iquesters/foundation

2. Run the migrations to add the foundation related tables to your database:

   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```
